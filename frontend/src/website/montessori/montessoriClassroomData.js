  bodyContent: "<h2>Children's House (Ages 3-6)</h2> <p>Dr. Maria Montessori characterized the 3 - 6 year-old child as possessing an extraordinary capacity to absorb information from his or her environment - an ability she termed &quot;the absorbent mind.&quot; A young child can learn his or her native language without the formal instruction and conscious effort an adult must make to learn a foreign language. They are like sponges, using all their senses to soak up information from their environment. The Montessori method of education allows children in this sensitive period to learn to read, write and calculate in the same natural way they learn to walk and talk.</p> <p>A typical three-year primary program begins when a child is about 3 years old and is toileting independently. The mixed-age classroom provides an opportunity for younger children to learn from older peers, while older children learn patience and nurturing as well as gain great satisfaction in teaching a younger child how to complete a &quot;work.&quot; Ideally, the child will then remain with the same teacher in the same classroom for the three-year program, which includes completion of the traditional &quot;kindergarten&quot; year. This allows the child to work at his or her own pace, learning from others along the way and to finally become the older child who passes on knowledge to the younger children, thereby reinforcing his or her own knowledge and boosting confidence.</p>",

  bodyContent: '<h2>Lower Elementary (Ages 6-9)</h2> <p>Our Lower Elementary Program continues to offer respect for the individual in a classroom while recognizing the developmental need for socialization and community. The curriculum is designed to meet the needs of children in the 2nd plane of development which Montessori defined as ages six through twelve. It covers the traditional grades of first through third in a multi-sensory, multi-aged classroom. The elementary child follows Montessori’s plan of the &quot;Cosmic Curriculum.&quot; The goals of Cosmic Education go far beyond the usual goals of skill development and knowledge acquisition to address the development of the whole person. Children who complete the Cosmic Curriculum have a clear understanding of the natural world, of human knowledge, and of themselves. These children when continuing through upper elementary are prepared to leave childhood behind and to enter adolescence as independent, confident, responsible, emotionally intelligent individuals, balanced in physical, intellectual and social achievements. They will be academically and practically prepared to pursue self-education in many areas; to make responsible decisions and act on them in a responsible way; to recognize limits and give, ask for, and receive help. Special classes, woven into the students’ week, are an integral part of the NCM curriculum such as Science, Team Building, Eco-Lab and Spanish and a week-long environmental education at our Nature’s Classroom Institute. Students also participate in enriching field trips, as well as regular trips to the library.</p>',

  bodyContent: '<h2>Adolescent (Ages 12-18)</h2> <blockquote>“Life in the open air, in the sunshine… the calm surroundings, the silence, the wonders of nature satisfy the need of the adolescent for reflection and contemplation… For it is not the country itself that is so valuable, but work in the country and work generally with its wide social connotations of productiveness and earning power. The observation of nature has not only a side that is philosophical and scientific, it has also a side of social experiences that leads on to observations of civilization and the life of men.” <br />--Maria Montessori</blockquote> <p>The mission of the Nature’s Classroom Institute Montessori School’s Adolescent Program is to allow each student to interact freely with the prepared environment. The environment will be one that fulfills the needs of each child physically, intellectually, and emotionally in accordance with their studies. The students will engage mentally and physically in practical life work, that will put meaning and action to their elementary knowledge. They will study and progress in a safe environment with the end goal of self-confidence and self-worth in their abilities and accomplishments as well as a complete understanding of the world community. Our school farm will guide the child with meaningful, practical adult work, allowing the student to see the true importance of their contributions and hard work. A classroom micro-economy will allow the students independence and financial responsibility, and give the students an understanding of the role the economy plays in adult society. The students will also begin to understand where they best can contribute within that economy.</p> <p>Their mental development will progress through a rigorous study of mathematics and an intricate use of both Spanish and English will offer them new and enriching opportunities. The students will expand their knowledge to prepare for the next stage in their lives through occupational studies of the sciences and the humanities.These will provide them with concrete experiences to understand the fragility and importance of the natural world, teach them pedagogy of place and the inter-dependencies of future generations on their current time and place. Our adolescent students will have opportunities to express their emotions in constructive and positive forms of creative expression, art, music, drama, and language in an environment rich with culture, experiences, and self-reflection. Upon graduation from our program each student should transition into the community with a solid knowledge base of the world and self-confidence with their abilities and contributions. </p>',
